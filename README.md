# NOS
This is the home of NOS, the Not an OS Linux desktop distribution.

## Status: Research Phase
This repository currently only contains documentation and research around the concept of this distribution.

## Raison d'Etre
The purpose of NOS is to be a management layer for your computer's operating system or systems.  It is not intended to be used directly for any kind of workload, but instead to manage the storage and processing requirements for standard desktop environments.

 * Bootloader
 * Blue-green update mechanism
 * Configurable Storage Engine
 * Workload orchestrator
 * Hypervisor
 * Container runtime
 * NOS Configuration Service
 * Emulation engines
 * NOS Library (external library of recipes for systems)
