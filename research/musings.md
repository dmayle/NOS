# Musings
This is the place for random notes and musings about anything related to NOD

 * We should be re-using as much code / conventions from other projects as possible
 * In many ways, this is very similar to a Kubernetes worker
 * The container engine should not / will not allow non-root loads
 * Maybe the container engine should be hosted inside of a VM for isolation purposes
 * There will be no UI in NOS, if necessary, a workload will be added with a UI
